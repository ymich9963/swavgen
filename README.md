# swavgen: Simple WAV File Generator
A simple tool to generate different sound waves types in WAV format with no external dependencies. A great resource to understand very simple DSP and audio software development. It really helped me understand C data types and how to adhere to coding for a standard format. I couldn't find something similar online so I thought it would be a nice simple project to do.
