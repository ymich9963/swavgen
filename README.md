# swavgen: Simple wave.WAV File Generator
A simple tool to generate WAVE (.wav) files containing different wave types and encodings with no external dependencies! A great resource to understand very simple DSP and audio software development. The ideal end of the project is to implement all possible WAVE formats listed in the [IANA WAVE and AVI Codec Registries](https://www.iana.org/assignments/wave-avi-codec-registry/wave-avi-codec-registry.xhtml).

## Why
It really helped me understand C data types and how to adhere to coding for a standard format. I couldn't find something similar online so I thought it would be a nice simple project to do.
